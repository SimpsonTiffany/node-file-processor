The purpose of our lives is to be happy.
Life is what happens when you're busy making other plans.
Get busy living or get busy dying.
You only live once, but if you do it right, once is enough.
The future belongs to those who prepare for it today.
Success is no accident. It is hard work, perseverance, learning, and sacrifice.
Technology is best when it brings people together.
